# Python-Careerfoundry-project

In this project, we used Python to help the comapny Instacart to answer varioous questions about their customers. We used the Pandas library to help with the analysis. I explored how to use Python to wrangle data, perform consistency checks, derive new varibles, grouping data, aggregating variables and visualizations. In the resporsitory, you will find all the scripts I made for the project as well as the data sets I used.
